# Various python simulations of dynamical systems

and some notes on how these work

## Devcontainer

Crucially, this repo contains a `devcontainer`, a `dockerfile`, and an `env.yml` that creates an environment to run such types of simulations.
I'll probably mostly be using this repo for that.

Will avoid adding outputs to the repository so that the clone remains lightweight.
